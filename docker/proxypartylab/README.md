# Docker image for `proxypartylab`

Note that we do not keep the configurattion files themselves here!
Instead, go to <https://github.com/recaptime-dev/proxyparty-caddy>
for the Caddyfiles and other tidbits.

Normally speaking, it uses @ajhalili2006's custom caddy docker image
(handpicked from a nightly build on the other week) with the Doppler
CLI and a wrapper script around it.
